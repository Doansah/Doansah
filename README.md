## Hey 👋

My name is Dillon, and I’m a Computer Science student based in Towson, Maryland. I’m passionate about building backend systems and writing articles to help other CS students learn to code.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Amene** — an AI-powered learning tool that generates Knowledge Maps to help users understand and connect complex topics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Embabel**, a Java agent framework that integrates AI models into traditional object-oriented code.
